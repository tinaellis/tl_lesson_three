"Spiderman, Spiderman, Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size, Catches thieves just like
flies. Look out! Here comes the Spiderman. Is he strong? Listen bud—He's got radioactive blood.
Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead. Hey there! There goes the Spiderman.
In the chill of the night, At the scene of the crime, Like a streak of light, He arrives just in time!
Spiderman, Spiderman, Friendly neighborhood Spiderman. Wealth and fame, he's ignored—Action is his
reward. To him, Life is a great big bang-up— Wherever there's a hang-up, You'll find the Spiderman!"
