Introduction to Lesson 3

We're now going to completely switch gears and introduce you to web development. The main goals of this lesson (and the next) is working with HTTP, a stateless protocol. The statelessness of HTTP is what we, as web developers, spend all our effort managing. It's also why the internet is able to be so distributed and powerful. Understanding HTTP, and learning how to process requests and responses is the goal of this lesson.

We've made a couple of decisions in the web development section here:

We chose to not use OOP to manage our code. We've seen that many people get stuck on OOP and can't move forward, and we want people to focus on web development and primary, HTTP in this lesson. You can use OOP code if you chose to, but we won't in our solutions.

We chose to not include databases in this section, and instead chose to use the session, which is cookie-backed, for cheap persistence. Again, the reason is because many people get stuck on database concepts, which are important, but we want to direct focus on dealing with HTTP. We'll use a relational database in the next course.

This is a fun lesson, so try to be creative and have fun with the project. You'll learn more and you'll be proud of the application you deploy at the end.
